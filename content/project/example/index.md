title: Texture Classification using Local Binary Patterns and Deep Learning
summary: • Worked on Texture Classification using both ML(manual Feature Vector generation) and Deep Learning models).Implemented Local Binary Patterns(CLBP & MRELBP) using Tensorflow using KNN, SVM & Logistic Regression classifiers.Utilized Transfer learning for Bilinear CNN’s & AlexNet models on texture datasets ‐ classification accuracy b/w 90‐97%.
